# State Management — Pipeline-Runner Reference

How `running-a-pipeline` writes and reads pipeline state. Companion to `sk-pipeline-state` (which defines the schema).

## Read-on-startup flow

```
1. Resolve scope root via sk-pipeline-paths
2. Check for existing state in <scope-root>/superpipelines/temp/{P}/
   ├── No run dirs → fresh start; proceed to "initialize new state"
   ├── Found run dir with status: "running" AND started_at < 1h ago → live; refuse to start new
   ├── Found run dir with status: "running" AND started_at > 1h ago → crashed; prompt user (resume/restart/abort)
   ├── status: "completed" → "already done"; exit
   ├── status: "escalated" or "failed" → surface to human; do NOT auto-resume
   └── parse error → escalate to human; do NOT auto-resume
```

## Initialize new state

```bash
PIPELINE_NAME="my-pipeline"
SCOPE_ROOT=$(# resolved by sk-pipeline-paths)
RUN_ID=$(uuidgen)
PIPELINE_ID=$(uuidgen)
NOW=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
TEMP_DIR="${SCOPE_ROOT}/superpipelines/temp/${PIPELINE_NAME}/${RUN_ID}"
mkdir -p "$TEMP_DIR"
cat > "${TEMP_DIR}/pipeline-state.json.tmp" <<EOF
{
  "pipeline_id": "${PIPELINE_ID}",
  "pipeline_name": "${PIPELINE_NAME}",
  "scope_root": "${SCOPE_ROOT}",
  "run_id": "${RUN_ID}",
  "started_at": "${NOW}",
  "pattern": "${PATTERN}",
  "status": "running",
  "current_phase": 0,
  "phases": [...],
  "metadata": {}
}
EOF
mv "${TEMP_DIR}/pipeline-state.json.tmp" "${TEMP_DIR}/pipeline-state.json"
```

## Atomic write pattern

EVERY state update follows the write-temp-then-rename pattern:

```bash
TEMP_DIR="${SCOPE_ROOT}/superpipelines/temp/${PIPELINE_NAME}/${RUN_ID}"
STATE_FILE="${TEMP_DIR}/pipeline-state.json"
# 1. Read current state
STATE=$(cat "$STATE_FILE")
# 2. Modify (use jq for safety)
NEW_STATE=$(echo "$STATE" | jq --arg phase "$PHASE" '.current_phase = ($phase | tonumber)')
# 3. Write atomically
echo "$NEW_STATE" > "${STATE_FILE}.tmp"
mv "${STATE_FILE}.tmp" "$STATE_FILE"
```

## Phase transitions

| Transition | State change |
|------------|--------------|
| Phase starts | `phases[i].status = "running"` |
| Phase completes successfully | `phases[i].status = "done"`, `phases[i].outputs = [...]`, `current_phase = i+1` |
| Phase fails (recoverable) | `phases[i].status = "failed"`, `phases[i].error = "..."`, retry per status protocol |
| Phase fails (non-recoverable) | `status = "failed"` (top-level), surface to user |
| Pattern 3 hits max iterations | `status = "escalated"`, write last failure summary to metadata |
| Pipeline completes | `status = "completed"` |

## Resume protocol

When user accepts "resume" prompt for crashed state:

1. Validate `pipeline_id` matches what user expected.
2. Find `phases[i]` with `status: "running"`.
3. Reset `phases[i].status = "pending"` (assume in-progress work was lost).
4. If `phases[i]` had partial outputs that survived, prefer to keep them; otherwise re-dispatch from clean.
5. Continue from `current_phase = i`.

## Concurrent pipeline detection

Each pipeline name `{P}` has its own directory under `superpipelines/temp/`. Multiple named pipelines can run concurrently. Within the same `{P}`, only one active run is allowed:

```
echo "Active pipeline detected: $EXISTING_ID started $STARTED_AT"
echo "Cannot start new run of '${PIPELINE_NAME}'. Options:"
echo "  - Wait for active pipeline to finish"
echo "  - Resume the active run (opencode /superpipelines:run-pipeline --resume)"
echo "  - Abort the active run (rm -rf ${TEMP_DIR})"
exit 1
```

## Metadata fields used by runner

| Field | Type | Used for |
|-------|------|----------|
| `worktree_root` | string | Path to created worktree (for cleanup) |
| `task_count_target` | integer | Total tasks in pipeline (for progress display) |
| `task_progress` | object | `{ "T-1": "done", "T-2": "running", ... }` |
| `last_failure` | object | Pattern 3 escalation summary |
| `attempted_fixes` | array | Pattern 3 audit trail |

## Cleanup on success

```bash
TEMP_DIR="${SCOPE_ROOT}/superpipelines/temp/${PIPELINE_NAME}/${RUN_ID}"
STATE_FILE="${TEMP_DIR}/pipeline-state.json"
# Pipeline completed — mark status and delete temp dir
NEW_STATE=$(cat "$STATE_FILE" | jq '.status = "completed" | .completed_at = now | todate')
echo "$NEW_STATE" > "${STATE_FILE}.tmp"
mv "${STATE_FILE}.tmp" "$STATE_FILE"
# Temp dirs are deleted on DONE
rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"
```

## Cleanup on failure / escalation

Do NOT delete the temp directory. Surface to user with the absolute path so they can inspect:

```
echo "Pipeline ESCALATED. State preserved at: ${TEMP_DIR}/pipeline-state.json"
echo "Next steps documented in metadata.last_failure."
```

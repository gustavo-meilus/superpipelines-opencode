# Dispatch Protocols — Pipeline-Runner Reference

How `running-a-pipeline` dispatches workers and reviewers per pattern. Maps the canonical patterns from `sk-pipeline-patterns` to concrete `Task` calls (Claude Code) or in-session role-play (Tier 2/3).

## Common dispatch shape (Claude Code)

```
Task(
  subagent_type="pipeline-task-executor",
  description="Implement T-1: {short_name}",
  prompt="""
    Inputs:
      - task_text: <extracted from tasks.md>
      - spec_path: ./spec.md
      - plan_path: ./plan.md
      - project_context: <relevant files / commands>

    Output: emit one of DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / NEEDS_CONTEXT / BLOCKED with the agent's output schema.
  """
)
```

## Pattern 1 — Sequential

```
state.current_phase = 0
for phase in [Agent_A, Agent_B, Agent_C]:
  result = Task(phase, prompt with prior phase's output paths)
  if result.status != "DONE": handle per status protocol
  state.update(phase done, outputs=result.outputs)
```

## Pattern 2 / 2b — Parallel Fan-Out

Dispatch all branch workers in a SINGLE message block (true parallelism).

```
# Single message:
Task(Agent_A, ...)
Task(Agent_B, ...)
Task(Agent_C, ...)
# Wait for all results.
results = await all
if any(r.status != "DONE"): handle per status protocol per branch
Task(Merger, prompt with [out_a_path, out_b_path, out_c_path])
```

## Pattern 3 — Iterative Loop

```
for iteration in 1..MAX_ITERATIONS (3):
  test_result = Task(Tester, ...)
  if test_result.status == "DONE" and tests passed: break
  diagnosis = Task(Analyzer, prompt with test_result.outputs)
  if diagnosis says architectural: HARD-GATE escalate
  fix = Task(Fixer, prompt with diagnosis.outputs)
  if fix.status != "DONE": handle per status protocol
  if iteration >= 2 and failure_count_not_decreasing: HARD-GATE escalate
else:
  state.status = "escalated"
  surface to user
```

## Pattern 4 — Human-Gated

```
result = Task(Agent_A, ...)
write outputs
gate_response = AskUserQuestion("Phase 1 complete. APPROVE / REJECT / REVISE?")
match gate_response:
  APPROVE → continue
  REJECT  → state.status = "failed", surface to user
  REVISE  → Task(Agent_A, prompt = "REVISION: {feedback} + read {original_files}")
```

## Pattern 5 — Spec-Driven Development

```
# Phase 1-3
Task(pipeline-architect, ...) → spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md

# Phase 4 — preflight validation
analyze tasks.md: every AC covered? no orphans? no cycles?
if validation fails: BLOCK; ask architect to revise

# Phase 4b — HARD-GATE human approval
gate = AskUserQuestion("Spec and tasks written. Review before parallel implement. APPROVE / REVISE?")
if REVISE: route per 4D feedback table → re-spec or re-plan

# Phase 5 — parallel implement (per task)
for each task in tasks.md (respecting dependencies):
  worktree = create worktree per sk-worktree-safety
  exec_result = Task(pipeline-task-executor, prompt with extracted task text + worktree path)
  if exec_result.status != "DONE": handle per status protocol
  
  # Stage 1
  spec_result = Task(pipeline-spec-reviewer, prompt with spec.md path + exec_result.outputs)
  if spec_result.verdict == "FAIL":
    Task(pipeline-task-executor, prompt = "FIX: {spec_result.under_build + over_build}")
    re-Stage-1
  
  # Stage 2 (only if Stage 1 PASSed)
  qual_result = Task(pipeline-quality-reviewer, prompt with spec_result.verdict + exec_result.outputs)
  if qual_result.verdict == "FAIL" with critical/major:
    Task(pipeline-task-executor, prompt = "FIX: {qual_result.issues}")
    re-Stage-1 (full re-review, not just Stage 2)
  
  # Commit
  commit changes; merge to integration branch

# Phase 6 — reconcile
update pipeline-state.json with all task outcomes
```

## Tier 2/3 in-session role-play

When `Task` is unavailable, role-play each step:

1. State explicitly which agent role is being assumed: "Now adopting `pipeline-task-executor` role for T-1."
2. Read `agents/<name>.md` to refresh the role's rules.
3. Perform the task under the role's constraints.
4. Emit the agent's terminal status verbatim.
5. State explicitly when transitioning to a new role: "Switching to `pipeline-spec-reviewer` role for Stage 1 review of T-1."

Each role transition is a fresh mental context — re-read the spec, do not lean on what was just written.

## Status protocol handling

| Worker status | Orchestrator action |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `DONE` | Proceed to next phase. |
| `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` | Read concerns. If correctness/scope: address before review. If observational: proceed. |
| `NEEDS_CONTEXT` | Identify missing context; re-dispatch with same model + added context. |
| `BLOCKED` | (1) provide more context; (2) higher effort/model; (3) decompose; (4) escalate. NEVER retry same approach. |

NEVER ignore a non-`DONE` status. NEVER force a re-dispatch without addressing the root cause.

# Changelog

All notable changes to the `superpipelines-opencode` project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 1.2.2 — (2026-05-15)

### Fixed
- Plugin tools updated for opencode API compatibility: `args` schema format, `output`-wrapped return values

## 1.2.1 — (2026-05-11)

### Added
- implement superpipelines audit and failure analysis agents with state management tools

## 1.2.0 — (2026-05-11)

### Added
- **Phase 0: Pipeline Selection** — The `change-models` command now begins by reading the project's local registry and prompting the user to select which pipeline to modify. Auto-selects if only one pipeline exists. Includes an "All pipelines" option for bulk operations.
- **`$ARGUMENTS` Fast-Path** — When command arguments are provided (e.g., `all to opencode/big-pickle`), the tool auto-scopes pipeline selection to "All pipelines", auto-selects agents from the instruction target, skips mode selection, and parses arguments as a Mode C instruction. Still gates on user confirmation before any writes.
- **HARD-GATE for No-Arg Invocation** — When no arguments are provided, the tool must present three modes (A, B, C) to the user. Explicitly forbids inferring `$ARGUMENTS` from user model preferences, plugin configuration defaults, or any other source.
- **Deferred Catalog Presentation** — The model catalog is now assembled in Phase 1 but only presented in Phase 3 (during mode selection), saving context and reducing cognitive load.
- **Edge Case Handling** — Added graceful abort for empty registries and agent-less pipelines with user-facing messages.

### Changed
- **`skills/change-models/SKILL.md` — Major Overhaul**: Removed built-in core agent scanning (no longer accesses plugin installation directory). Removed user-scope scanning — only project-scoped pipeline agents are discovered. Config resolution now reads from the exact field path (`plugin[].models.default`) in `.opencode/opencode.json`. Renamed "Step numbers" to "Agent numbers (by table index)" throughout. Updated all Phase numbers (0-5 after renumbering). Purged all core agent references from examples and descriptions. Added new invariant, Red Flag, and rationalization entry for the preferences-as-intent fallacy.
- **`.opencode/agents/release-manager.md`**: Agent model changed from `opencode/big-pickle` to `opencode/deepseek-v4-pro`.

### Removed
- **Built-in Core Agent Scanning**: The change-models command no longer scans the plugin installation directory for built-in core agents.
- **User-Scope Agent Scanning**: Removed discovery of agents from `~/.opencode/agents/superpipelines/**/*.md`. Only project-scoped pipeline agents are now supported.

## 1.1.0 — (2026-05-11)

### Added
- **New Command: `/superpipelines:change-models`** — Interactive model reassignment across pipeline agents and built-in core agents. Discovers available models from OpenCode Zen, OpenCode Go, and custom providers. Supports three modes: bulk apply, individual selection, and natural language instruction (e.g., "steps 1-3 to opencode Qwen 3.6 Plus"). Registered as `superpipelines:change-models` command and `change-models` skill.
- **Plugin Version Stamping (`plugin_version`)** — Every pipeline artifact now includes a `plugin_version` field set to the current superpipelines package version. Enables future retro-compatibility checks. Stamped in `topology.json`, `registry.json` entries, `pipeline-state.json`, and agent YAML frontmatter. Updated on every mutation (create, add-step, update-step, delete-step). Advisory warning on major version mismatch when running a pipeline.
- **Bootstrap Version Injection** — The plugin now injects the current package version into every conversation alongside model preferences, so skills and agents know the exact version at runtime.
- **Model Catalog Reference** — Added `skills/change-models/references/model-catalog.md` — a curated static fallback catalog listing all OpenCode Zen (43 models), OpenCode Go (12 models), and common built-in/custom provider models for offline model discovery.

### Changed
- **Moved `release-manager` from plugin to project-level** — The `release-manager` agent is no longer shipped in the npm package (`agents/`). It now lives at `.opencode/agents/release-manager.md` as a project-level agent specific to this repository's release workflow.
- **Updated pipeline mutation skills** — `creating-a-pipeline`, `adding-a-pipeline-step`, `updating-a-pipeline-step`, `deleting-a-pipeline-step`, `change-models`, `running-a-pipeline`, and `sk-pipeline-state` all now require `plugin_version` stamping.
- **Updated audit references** — Added `plugin_version` requirements to `topology-rules.md`, `compliance-matrix.md`, `agent-frontmatter-schema.md`, and `pipeline-architect.md`.
- **Updated routing table** — Added `change-models` entry to `skills/using-superpipelines/SKILL.md`.
- **Updated `src/index.ts`** — Registers `change-models` command, injects plugin version into bootstrap content, reads version from `package.json`.

### Removed
- **`agents/release-manager.md`**: Removed from the plugin's `agents/` directory. Moved to `.opencode/agents/release-manager.md` (project-level).

## 1.0.12 — (2026-05-07)

### Fixed
- **Agent `hidden` and `mode` Frontmatter Forwarding**: The plugin now reads and forwards `mode` and `hidden` properties from agent YAML frontmatter to the OpenCode agent config. Previously these fields were silently discarded by destructuring into `...rest`, causing subagents with `hidden: true` to still appear in `@` autocomplete.

## 1.0.11 — (2026-05-07)

### Added
- **Subagent Configuration Properties**: Added `mode: subagent` and `hidden: true` frontmatter to all seven pipeline subagents (`pipeline-architect`, `pipeline-auditor`, `pipeline-failure-analyzer`, `pipeline-quality-reviewer`, `pipeline-spec-reviewer`, `pipeline-task-executor`, `skill-architect`) to mark them as internal subagents hidden from `@` autocomplete.
- **Agent Frontmatter Schema**: Documented `mode` and `hidden` fields in the agent frontmatter schema reference and opencode conventions skill.

## 1.0.10 — (2026-05-06)

### Added
- **Enhanced Agent Loading with Scope Root Support**: Improved agent loading and configuration management to properly support scope root detection and agent file resolution across local, project, and user scopes.

### Changed
- **Default Model Update**: Updated default models to use `opencode/big-pickle` across all configuration files, including `.opencode/opencode.json`, `README.md`, `TESTING.md`, and source files.

## 1.0.9 — (2026-05-06)

### Added
- **Built-in Command Registration (`config.command`)**: The server plugin now auto-registers all built-in SuperPipelines commands (`superpipelines:new-pipeline`, `superpipelines:run-pipeline`, `superpipelines:new-step`, `superpipelines:update-step`, `superpipelines:delete-step`, `superpipelines:audit-pipeline`, `superpipelines:init-deep`) from `commands/*.md` files during the `config` lifecycle hook.
- **Dynamic Pipeline Command Discovery**: User-created pipelines under `.opencode/superpipelines/{P}/{P}.md` are automatically discovered and registered as `superpipelines:{P}` commands at config time, enabling direct execution via `/superpipelines:{P}`.
- **TUI Pipeline Command Discovery**: The TUI plugin now dynamically discovers pipeline commands from both project-level (`.opencode/superpipelines/`) and user-level (`~/.opencode/superpipelines/`) scope roots, displaying them as "Run: {P}" entries in the slash command palette.
- **Manual Testing Guide (`TESTING.md`)**: Comprehensive 372-line manual testing document covering build verification, type-checking, config hook validation, TUI plugin testing, bootstrap injection verification, CRLF regression testing, and end-to-end scenario tests.

### Changed
- **TUI Slash Command Format**: Standardized all built-in TUI slash commands to use full `superpipelines:*` names (e.g., `/superpipelines:new-pipeline`) instead of short aliases (`/sp:new`), improving consistency with the command registration system.
- **`creating-a-pipeline` Skill**: Updated Phase 5 to generate a per-pipeline run command file at `<scope-root>/superpipelines/{P}/{P}.md`, enabling direct pipeline execution. Updated user confirmation message to reference the new `/superpipelines:{P}` command.
- **`sk-pipeline-paths` Skill**: Added "Run Command" path template (`superpipelines/{P}/{P}.md`) to the canonical path reference table.

## 1.0.8 — (2026-05-06)

### Added
- **TUI Plugin Module (`src/tui.ts`)**: Added the `./tui` export required by OpenCode's plugin loader, resolving the "Package has no TUI target to load in this app" error. The TUI module registers slash commands (`/sp:new`, `/sp:run`, `/sp:add`, `/sp:update`, `/sp:delete`) and shows toast notifications on session idle/error events.
- **PluginModule Export Format**: Changed `src/index.ts` to export a `PluginModule` object (`{ id, server }`) instead of a raw `Plugin` function, matching the official `@opencode-ai/plugin` spec.

### Changed
- Updated `package.json` exports to include `"./tui"` subpath.
- Updated build script to compile both `src/index.ts` and `src/tui.ts`.

## 1.0.0 — Initial Release (2026-05-05)

### Added
- **Forked Release**: Officially forked from [superpipelines v1.0.4](https://github.com/gustavo-meilus/superpipelines), which was originally designed for Claude Code.
- **Native OpenCode TS Plugin**: Implemented a native TypeScript architecture (`src/index.ts`) utilizing the `@opencode-ai/plugin` SDK, replacing legacy bash hooks and static manifests.
- **Dynamic Context Injection**: Utilizes `experimental.chat.messages.transform` to safely inject the `using-superpipelines` skill context into the first user message, eliminating redundant token bloat.
- **Zero-Copy Config Registration**: Hooks into the OpenCode `config` lifecycle to dynamically register the bundled `skills/` and `agents/` directories without requiring the user to manually copy them into their workspace.
- **TUI Command Interception**: Native TUI interception for `/superpipelines:*` slash commands, seamlessly redirecting the user to natural language orchestration within OpenCode.
- **OpenCode Model Compatibility**: Fully migrated agent models to OpenCode ecosystem standards (e.g., `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`).

### Changed
- Refactored `CLAUDE.md` to `OPENCODE.md` and comprehensively purged all Claude Code specific nomenclature.
- Migrated legacy `isolation: worktree` agent parameters to prompt-enforced isolation via the `sk-worktree-safety` skill.
- Replaced the `.claudeignore` with `.opencodeignore`.

### Removed
- Removed the `hooks/` directory and `.claude-plugin/` legacy infrastructure.
- Removed legacy `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` manifests in favor of `package.json` driven OpenCode configuration.

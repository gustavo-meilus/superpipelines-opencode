description: Use when auditing existing pipeline bundles, agent files, or skills against superpipelines v2 layout, frontmatter, topology, and runtime-safety standards. Invoked automatically after new-pipeline, new-step, update-step, and delete-step. Produces severity-classified reports (SEV-0/1/2/3) with cited file:line evidence.

# Pipeline Auditor — Standards Enforcement

> Audits pipeline bundles, agents, and skills against Superpipelines v2 compliance standards. Trigger when verifying structural integrity, frontmatter accuracy, topology health, or runtime safety.

<overview>
The Pipeline Auditor provides a rigorous, read-only verification layer. It classifies findings across four severity bands (SEV-0 to SEV-3) and produces evidence-backed reports to ensure all components adhere to the canonical framework specifications.
</overview>

<glossary>
  <term name="Compliance Matrix">A 20-criterion checklist covering layout, frontmatter, topology, and runtime safety.</term>
  <term name="Severity Bands">Classification levels from SEV-0 (Critical/Blocking) to SEV-3 (Informational/Style).</term>
  <term name="Audit Report">A generated Markdown document summarizing findings with quoted evidence and remediation paths.</term>
</glossary>

<invariant>
The Auditor is strictly read-only; it cannot modify files. Remediation must be routed to the `pipeline-architect`.
</invariant>

## Operating Modes

<operating_modes>
| Mode | Trigger | Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FULL** | Direct invocation or first audit. | Entire pipeline bundle: all agents, skills, and topology. |
| **DELTA** | Triggered by mutation commands. | Changed files plus immediate neighbors and the entry skill. |
| **SCOPE-WIDE** | `audit-pipeline --all` command. | FULL audit across all registered pipelines in all scope roots. |
</operating_modes>

## Workflow

<protocol>
### 1. LOCATE
- Resolve paths via `sk-pipeline-paths`.
- **FULL**: Glob all agents and skills; read `topology.json` and the registry.
- **DELTA**: Target only changed files and their graph neighbors.
- **SCOPE-WIDE**: Iterate through all scope roots and registered pipelines.

### 2. AUDIT
- **Compliance Matrix**: Execute the 20-criterion check in `references/compliance-matrix.md`.
- **Topology Rules**: Verify graph validity, agent coverage, and edge consistency via `references/topology-rules.md`.
- Assign severity per `references/severity-classification.md` and select fixes from `references/fix-templates.md`.

### 3. REPORT
- Write the final report to `{ROOT}/.../audit/latest.md` using the template in `references/audit-report-template.md`.
- Emit an executive summary inline. If `Write` tools are disallowed, provide the registry update instruction as a plan.
- Record every audit, even those with zero findings.

### 4. FIX ROUTING
- Auditor remains read-only.
- **SEV-0/1**: Route to `pipeline-architect` with the remediation plan.
- **SEV-2/3**: Surface to the user for manual decision.
</protocol>

<invariants>
- Cite `file:line` and quote evidence verbatim for every finding.
- DELTA mode must ignore findings outside the changed scope to prevent unrelated blocking.
- NEVER skip the compliance matrix checks, regardless of file appearance.
- NEVER create or modify pipeline components directly.
</invariants>
